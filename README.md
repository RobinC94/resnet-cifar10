# resnet-cifar10

This project works for my pending paper "CNN Compressing Method". I'm trying to modify kernels in hidden layers with linear representation and propotional fitting, deploying with ResNet-20 Network with Cifar-10 datasets, showed in paper [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
